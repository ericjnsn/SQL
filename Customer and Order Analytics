#In this SQL, I'm querying a databse with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February?
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length (feb.orderID) = 6
AND feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT
    Product,
    price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (
    SELECT min (price)
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    );
   
#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT
    product,
    sum (Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product <> 'Product'
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St. Seatlle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
    Product,
    sum(Quantity),
    sum (Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
    count(distinct cust.acctnum),
    avg (Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2
AND length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
